# Machine Learning with Python

## 📄 Summary 
This course provides an overview of the purpose of Machine Learning, and where it applies to the real world. It covers topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and various useful Machine Learning algorithms. Many example projects are embarked upon and explored, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, and recommendation engines. The final project within this course is the building of a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off.
