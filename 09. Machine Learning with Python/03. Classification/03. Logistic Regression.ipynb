So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about the confusion matrix is that it shows the model’s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes.  In a specific case of the binary classifier, such as this example,  we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.73      0.96      0.83        25\n","           1       0.86      0.40      0.55        15\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.75        40\n","   macro avg       0.79      0.68      0.69        40\n","weighted avg       0.78      0.75      0.72        40\n","\n"]}],"source":["print (classification_report(y_test, yhat))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Based on the count of each section, we can calculate precision and recall of each label:\n","\n","*   **Precision** is a measure of the accuracy provided that a class label has been predicted.
